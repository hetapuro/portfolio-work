# Project management software
This project was done during summer 2023 while I worked as a ICT Trainee at South-Eastern Finland University of Applied Sciences. The software is currently being worked on and is a part of my thesis work.

The software works as a tool for students and teachers to keep track of studentsâ€™ progress regarding project courses. The software has unique needs from a design aspect as it is constantly under development. The initial version of this application was made in 2020 by Harto Kuukka. I fully designed and refactored it using the initial version as a base.
